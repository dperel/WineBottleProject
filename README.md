Instructions:

Register as a regular user (wine distributor, merchant, auction house or a collector) or as a vineyard / winemaker. We will want your name, contact information and where you are based, but we will never share your information with others.

If your are making an account for a vineyard, you are able to create new wine bottles and enter them into the system. Each bottle will be issued with a unique identifier which serves dual purpose: it becomes a permanent part of blockchain, which can be never altered, and it can be used to tag the bottle to ensure that the physical product matches its digital identity. 

Your bottles are dislayed in your cellar; you can also see records of the bottles you have once owned but either sold or withdrew for the system after consuming them. For your current wine collection, you can view a map charting your bottles' journeys from owner to owner, based on the geographic information from the profiles of prior owners. 

Your privacy is paramount to us.  Buyers of wine bottles are able to track the prior locations of their bottles, back to its vineyard of origin, but they are unable to see the personal information of its previous owners. 

Bitcoin's blockchain technology prevents fraudulent sales of unauthentic or stolen wine bottles. Before you commit to purchasing a bottle of wine, or before someone else commits to purchasing a bottle from you, the bottle's unique identifier can be located in the blockchain, allowing both parties to confirm the seller's rightful ownership of that bottle. Our software tools also allow you to trace the bottle back to its vineyard of origin, confirming its authenticity.
