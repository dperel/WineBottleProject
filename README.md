30 BILLION bottles of wine are sold - every year. Stem uses blockchain technology to securely verify and track track luxury goods.

Stem solves the trust problem between buyers and sellers, creating a durable and immutable record of sales and manufacturing history while keeping your identity private.

Instructions:

Register as a regular user (wine distributor, merchant, auction house or a collector) or as a vineyard / winemaker. We will want your name, contact information and where you are based, but we will never share your information with others.

If your account is that of a vineyeard, you are able to create new bottles and enter them into the system. Each bottle will be issued with a unique identifier which serves dual purpose: it becomes permanent part of blockchain can be never altered, and it can be used to mark the bottle to ensure that the physical product matches its digital identity. 

Your bottles are dislayed in your cellar; you can also see records of the bottles that you used to own but that are no longer in your possession. For your current bottles if your are not a vineyard that has bottled them, you can see the cities where the users who were links in the transaction chain reside -- all mapped out as a bottle's journey on the map. As you sell or otherwise transfer ownership of your bottles, those who take ownership will be able to see where the transaction took place, but never your identitity. 

Before you commit to purchasing a bottle of wine, or before someone else commits to purchasing a bottle from you, the bottle's unique identifier can be run through the blockchain to verify that the bottle is indeed in possession of whomever claims to own it and that it has not been double-spent.
